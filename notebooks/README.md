# Notebooks

These are all the Jupyter notebooks we used to generate figures in the paper. There are CSV files in this directory included primarily for convenience of running; they are all identical to the data provided in the `data` directory. These depend on the typical data science dependencies (`numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, etc), and `inflect`.
