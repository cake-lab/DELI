# DELI ðŸ¥ª

Nicholas Krichevsky, Matthew St Louis, Tian Guo

This is the repository associated with our paper: Quantifying and Improving Performance of Distributed Deep Learning with Cloud Storage, to be published in [IC2E 2021](https://conferences.computer.org/IC2E/2021/).

## Directory Structure

- `src` includes the various components used to implement and test DELI.
- `data` includes the raw data collected for the purposes of the paper.
- `notebooks` includes the Jupyter Notebooks used to create the figures in the paper.

Each directory has its own relevant README to help guide setup; these are generally fairly complete, but not necessarily exact in the steps needed for setup. The authors encourage anyone with questions to reach out or to file an issue. Certain oddities that were in place for our testing are left in, simply to ensure the setup used is known.
