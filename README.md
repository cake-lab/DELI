This is the official repository associated with our paper: Quantifying and Improving Performance of Distributed Deep Learning with Cloud Storage, to be published in [IC2E 2021](https://conferences.computer.org/IC2E/2021/).

## Overview 

DELI ðŸ¥ª is a PyTorch-based prototype for enabling efficient distributed deep learning using cloud storage buckets. Specifically, DELI allows trainining data to be stored using storage buckets and leverages two classical techniques, namely caching and pre-fetching, to mitigate the training performance degradation. We evaluated the training performance of two deep learning workloads using Google Cloudâ€™s NVIDIA K80 GPU servers and show that we can reduce the time that the training loop is waiting for data by 85.6% - 93.5% compared to loading from a storage bucketâ€”thus achieving comparable performance to loading data directly from disk while only storing a fraction of the data locally at a time. In addition, this has the potential of lowering the cost of running a training workload, especially on models with long per-epoch training times.

## Directory Structure

- `src` includes the various components used to implement and test DELI.
- `data` includes the raw data collected for the purposes of the paper.
- `notebooks` includes the Jupyter Notebooks used to create the figures in the paper.

Each directory has its own relevant README to help guide setup; these are generally fairly complete, but not necessarily exact in the steps needed for setup. The authors encourage anyone with questions to reach out or to file an issue. Certain oddities that were in place for our testing are left in, simply to ensure the setup used is known.
